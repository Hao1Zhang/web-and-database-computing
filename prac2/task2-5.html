    <h1>A page withsome divs and spans</h1>
    <p>this page looks much cleanner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background</p>
    <p>because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
    <br>this allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span>because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respecitively.</p>
    <p>on the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>

<div>
    <p>this text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
